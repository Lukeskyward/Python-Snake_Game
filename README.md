#Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

How to Play:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
The objective of the game is to eat the red apples that appear on the screen.
Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases, and the player's score is incremented.
The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game screen or if it collides with itself.
After the game ends, a "Game Over" screen is displayed with the final score.
To play again, press the Enter key.

Customization:
You can modify various aspects of the game by changing the values in the code:
The size of the game screen can be adjusted by modifying the width and height values.
The speed of the snake can be adjusted by changing the tick rate in the clock.tick() function.
The appearance of the snake and the apple can be customized by modifying the colors and dimensions in the code.
The font style and size used for displaying the score and game over messages can be changed by modifying the respective pygame.font.Font instances.
